turn on robot, check if bluetooth is on, check if robot is not connected to another port
bluetooth connect your device to the robot, Petoi-30AD, pin is 0000,\
once connected it should disconnect after a couple seconds, your computer now recognizes bittle a a port
run $ python3 main.py

IF OFFLINE:
change recognize_google to recognize_sphinx




how does it work?
serial port connects in main
when succesful it calls on a main loop 
in the main loop:
    waits until command word is said to do anything
    once command word is said the robot will ask you what you want it to do
    turns speech into text
    when giving time you must follow up the time with seconds so the recognize_google knows you mean the number
    than text is then analzyed and lemmantized
    the analyzer will try to complete actions with the text given
    many actions can be given at once
    if there is an incomplete action it will save it and ask for you to complete it
    after analyzing the robot will run the command(s) 
    rinse and repeat untill one says quit, then code will end 
closes connection
